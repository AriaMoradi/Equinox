# Equinox for Tachidesk

This is a project for [Tachidesk](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Tachidesk). Built with Vue 3, Vite, TS, and also Storybook. A public Storybook instance is available at [https://equinix-storybook.netlify.app/](https://equinox-storybook.netlify.app/).

## Setup

To set up a development server, make sure you have Node.js installed and run `npm install`. Once that's done, run the server: `npm run dev`.

## Adolla

Note: while this is made by the same person who made [Adolla](https://github.com/adollaapp/adolla), this is not a successor. It's simply an alternative interface (WebUI) for Tachidesk.
